# hello-world
it was all a dream

My name is Carl-Gustav. I was born in Denmark, Copenhagen. When I was little and people asked me what my name was, I would answer with "Dudau". I'm very tired right now but I want to do this. I just feel like anything I write has very little to say about who I really am.
